## Use Docker image to run `tagionwallet`

> If you **don't have Docker**, follow the [Getting Started With Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) guide first.

Run the following command to run the `tagion/tagionwallet` Docker image:

```bash
docker pull tagion/tagionwallet # Pull the image from remote repository
docker run -it tagion/tagionwallet bash
tagionwallet --help # Will output help
```

By default, all files generated by the wallet in the container stay in the container. If you want to persist files, you need to mount a directory when running the container:

First, create the directory that you want to mount (you can use any directory you want):
```bash
# On Windows:
mkdir C:\tagionwallets

# On macOS or Linux
mkdir ~/tagionwallets
```

Then run the Docker container, mounting that directory:

```bash
# On Windows:
docker run -it -v C:\tagionwallets:/files tagion/tagionwallet bash

# On macOS or Linux
docker run -it -v ~/tagionwallets:/files tagion/tagionwallet bash
```

Now the `/files` directory in the container will match `C:\tagionwallets` or `~/tagionwallets` on your host machine. 

**Now you can proceed with the [AlphaOne manual](../README.md#alphaone-node-ip-addresses), like you have Ubuntu 20.04 and `tagionwallet` binary installed.**
